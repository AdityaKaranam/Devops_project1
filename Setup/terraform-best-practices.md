üîí Best Practices for AWS Authentication with Terraform

1. Use IAM Users or Roles‚ÄîNever the Root Account
	‚Ä¢	Why: Root credentials are too powerful; if leaked, your whole AWS org is at risk. Always use an IAM user with least privilege or a dedicated automation role.

2. Store Credentials Securely (Never Hardcode in Code)
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt put AWS keys in your Terraform files, Git, or scripts.
	‚Ä¢	Why: If your repo is public or even private but gets compromised, attackers can steal your cloud credentials.

3. Prefer Environment Variables or ~/.aws/credentials File
	‚Ä¢	Store access keys and secrets in:
	‚Ä¢	Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
	‚Ä¢	The standard ~/.aws/credentials file (created by aws configure)
	‚Ä¢	Why: Both are recognized by the AWS SDK and Terraform provider, and never get checked into source code.
	‚Ä¢	Example:

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx



4. Use IAM Roles with EC2 or Other Compute (If Running in Cloud)
	‚Ä¢	If running Terraform from EC2, CodeBuild, or GitHub Actions, assign an IAM role with correct permissions to the compute instance.
	‚Ä¢	Why: No static keys; IAM roles use temporary, auto-rotating credentials. Most secure for automation.

5. Scope IAM Permissions (Principle of Least Privilege)
	‚Ä¢	Use an IAM policy that grants only the permissions needed (e.g., just EC2/S3, not AdministratorAccess unless for home lab only).
	‚Ä¢	Why: Minimizes damage if a key is leaked.

6. Use Separate Accounts or Roles for Dev/Prod
	‚Ä¢	Separate credentials for personal/home/dev use and anything for work or ‚Äúproduction.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Why: Prevents accidental resource creation or deletion in wrong environment.

7. Rotate Credentials Regularly
	‚Ä¢	Delete/rotate old IAM keys, especially for any user accounts that may be shared or have been public.
	‚Ä¢	Why: Reduces risk from leaked/stale keys.

8. Never Share IAM User Credentials
	‚Ä¢	Each user or automation should have its own keys/roles.
	‚Ä¢	Why: For traceability and auditing.

‚∏ª

üõ°Ô∏è How This Looks in Practice (for Your Project):
	1.	Use a dedicated IAM user in your Dev account.
	2.	Run aws configure on your RHEL workstation (recommended)
	‚Ä¢	Stores keys in ~/.aws/credentials (used automatically by Terraform).
	3.	Alternatively, use environment variables only when needed for automation (CI/CD).
	4.	Never put keys in .tf files, scripts, or checked-in code.

üìã Terraform AWS Provider Block Example

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  # Do not include access_key or secret_key here!
  # Terraform will use the credentials in ~/.aws/credentials or ENV variables
}

üßë‚Äçüíª How to Answer in an Interview:

‚ÄúI authenticate Terraform with AWS by using a dedicated IAM user with least privilege, and store my credentials securely in the standard AWS credentials file or as environment variables. I never hardcode secrets in Terraform files or scripts, and for automation in cloud environments I always use IAM roles with temporary credentials for best security.‚Äù

Would you like a mini hands-on for setting up your credentials and a starter provider block for Terraform? Or do you want to see an example IAM policy for least-privilege Terraform use?
