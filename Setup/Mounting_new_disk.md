I'll help you understand Linux disk management and walk you through adding a new 25GB mount point. Let me start with an architecture diagram to visualize how everything fits together.Now let me explain each term and layer in the architecture:

## Key Terms Explained

**1. Physical Disk (/dev/sdc)**
- This is your actual 25GB virtual disk that UTM presents to RHEL
- Linux sees it as `/dev/sdc` (the third SCSI disk)
- Think of it as a raw, unformatted storage device

**2. Disk Initialization**
- This means preparing the disk for use by creating a partition table
- It's like creating a "table of contents" that tells the system how the disk is divided
- Common partition table types: MBR (older) or GPT (newer, recommended)

**3. Partition (/dev/sdc1)**
- A partition is a logical division of a physical disk
- It's like dividing a large room with walls - each section can be used differently
- Your 25GB disk will have one partition: `/dev/sdc1`

**4. Physical Volume (PV)**
- In LVM, a Physical Volume is a partition or disk that LVM can use
- It's the lowest level of LVM - think of it as a "building block"
- Your `/dev/sdc1` partition becomes a Physical Volume

**5. Volume Group (VG)**
- A Volume Group combines one or more Physical Volumes into a storage pool
- It's like a big container that holds all your available storage
- RHEL typically uses a VG named "rhel" by default
- You can add your new PV to this existing VG

**6. Logical Volume (LV)**
- Created from space in a Volume Group
- It's like carving out a specific amount of space for a particular purpose
- This is what you'll actually format with a filesystem

**7. Filesystem**
- The structure that organizes data on the Logical Volume
- Common types: ext4 (general purpose), xfs (good for large files)
- It's like the filing system in a cabinet

**8. Mount Point (/project)**
- A directory where the filesystem is attached to the Linux directory tree
- After mounting, you can access your 25GB storage at `/project`

## The Process Flow

Here's what happens when you add your new disk:

1. **UTM adds virtual disk** → Linux sees `/dev/sdc`
2. **Initialize disk** → Create partition table on `/dev/sdc`
3. **Create partition** → Make `/dev/sdc1` partition
4. **Create Physical Volume** → `pvcreate /dev/sdc1`
5. **Extend Volume Group** → Add PV to existing "rhel" VG
6. **Create Logical Volume** → Carve out 25GB LV named "project"
7. **Create filesystem** → Format LV with ext4 or xfs
8. **Create mount point** → `mkdir /project`
9. **Mount filesystem** → Connect LV to `/project` directory
10. **Make permanent** → Add entry to `/etc/fstab`

## Why Use LVM?

LVM (Logical Volume Manager) provides flexibility:
- **Resize**: Grow or shrink volumes later
- **Snapshots**: Create point-in-time backups
- **Multiple disks**: Combine several disks into one volume
- **Migration**: Move data between disks without downtime

Would you like me to provide the actual commands to accomplish this task, or do you have questions about any of these concepts first?

Awesome! Here’s a step-by-step guide to add a new virtual disk in UTM and create a /project mount on RHEL using LVM. This process is safe, fast, and commonly used in enterprise Linux setups.

⸻

Step-by-Step: Add a New Virtual Disk and Create /project

⸻

1. Add a New Virtual Disk in UTM

a. Shut down your RHEL VM if it’s running.

b. In UTM, open your RHEL VM’s settings.

c. Go to the Drives section and click the ”+” or Add Drive button.

d. Choose Create New Drive (set size to 20GB, type: “NVMe”, “VirtIO”, or “SCSI”—doesn’t matter much for this test).

e. Save and boot your RHEL VM.

⸻

2. Find the New Disk in Linux

After logging in:

lsblk

Look for a new device (likely /dev/vdb, /dev/sdb, or similar) that’s 20G and has no partitions.
[akarnam@m2 Tools]$ lsblk
NAME             MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda                8:0    0   10G  0 disk /run/media/akarnam/RHEL-9-6-0-BaseOS-aarch64
vda              252:0    0   64G  0 disk 
├─vda1           252:1    0  600M  0 part /boot/efi
├─vda2           252:2    0    1G  0 part /boot
└─vda3           252:3    0 62.4G  0 part 
  ├─rhel_m2-root 253:0    0 39.3G  0 lvm  /
  ├─rhel_m2-swap 253:1    0  3.9G  0 lvm  [SWAP]
  └─rhel_m2-home 253:2    0 19.2G  0 lvm  /home
nvme0n1          259:0    0   25G  0 disk

⸻

3. Create a Physical Volume (PV) on the New Disk

Replace /dev/vdb with your actual device!

sudo pvcreate /dev/vdb

[akarnam@m2 Tools]$ sudo pvcreate /dev/nvme0n1
[sudo] password for akarnam: 
  Physical volume "/dev/nvme0n1" successfully created.


⸻

4. Extend Your Volume Group to Include the New PV

sudo vgextend rhel_m2 /dev/nvme0n1
[akarnam@m2 Tools]$ sudo vgextend rhel_m2 /dev/nvme0n1
[sudo] password for akarnam: 
  Volume group "rhel_m2" successfully extended
[akarnam@m2 Tools]$ 

⸻

5. Create a New Logical Volume for /project

sudo lvcreate -L 25G -n project rhel_m2

execution
Excellent troubleshooting step! This error is common when working with LVM and it’s great that you’re trying to create a new logical volume.

⸻

What does the error mean?

Volume group "rhel_m2" has insufficient free space (6399 extents): 6400 required.

	•	You requested: A logical volume of 25GB (-L 25G).
	•	The VG (rhel_m2) only has: 6399 extents of free space.
	•	But 25GB needs: 6400 extents.

In simple terms:
Your volume group is just a tiny bit short of the 25GB you requested. This happens due to how LVM allocates space in fixed-size “extents” (chunks of storage), and sometimes there’s a small overhead.

⸻

How to fix it?

Solution:
Just request a slightly smaller size for your new logical volume—try 24.9G or 24.8G instead of 25G.

Example:

sudo lvcreate -L 24.9G -n project rhel_m2

Or even:

sudo lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n project rhel_m2

	•	This uses all available free space in the volume group, whatever the exact number is.

⸻

Summary Table

Command	What it does
sudo lvcreate -L 24.9G -n project rhel_m2	Create LV with slightly less than 25G
sudo lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n project rhel_m2	Use all free space in the VG for the LV


⸻

Try the above commands, and let me know if it works!
Would you like to know more about how LVM extents work or continue with formatting and mounting your new LV?


[akarnam@m2 Tools]$ sudo lvcreate -L 24.9G -n project rhel_m2
  Rounding up size to full physical extent 24.90 GiB
  Logical volume "project" created.
[akarnam@m2 Tools]$ 
⸻

6. Format the New Logical Volume

sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/rhel_m2/project


⸻

7. Create the Mount Point and Mount It

sudo mkdir /project


sudo mount /dev/rhel_m2/project /project

Check:

df -h /project

You should see 20G available at /project.

⸻

8. Make the Mount Permanent

Edit /etc/fstab and add this line:

/dev/rhel_m2/project   /project    xfs    defaults    0 0

Test it (to catch typos!):

sudo mount -a

No errors means you’re good!

⸻

Summary Table

Step	Command Example
Add new disk in UTM	(GUI)
Find disk	lsblk
Create PV	pvcreate /dev/vdb
Extend VG	vgextend rhel_m2 /dev/vdb
Create LV	lvcreate -L 20G -n project rhel_m2
Format LV	mkfs.xfs /dev/rhel_m2/project
Mount LV	mkdir /project; mount ...
Edit fstab	Add entry for /project


⸻

Practice Exercise
	•	Create a test file in /project and check that it persists after reboot.
	•	Try filling /project to see what happens when it fills up (it won’t affect root!).
